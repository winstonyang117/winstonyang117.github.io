### Biography 

I believe each experience will build us more comprehensive. We can not connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking backwards. These dots will somehow connect in our future.

I have a interdisciplinary background and my research interest lies broadly in computer vision, big data and data analytics, biomedical signal&image processing, machine learning, robotics and embedded systems.

I earned my MS in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2021), working with Professor Negar Tavassolian on contactless vital signs measurement and analysis via FMCW radar. Prior to attending Stevens, I obtained my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Changchun University of Science and Technology (2018).

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a data scientist in Advanced Analytics Group at UPS. And at the same time, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. degree for my future career.
