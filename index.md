### Biography 

I believe each experience will build us more comprehensive. We can not connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking backwards. These dots will be somehow connected in our future.

I have an interdisciplinary background and my research interest lies broadly in computer vision, big data and data analytics, biomedical signal&image processing, machine learning, robotics and embedded systems.

I earned my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2021), advised by [Prof. Lei Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/leiwupes/News?authuser=0). I also worked with [Prof. Negar Tavassolian](https://www.tavassolian-lab.com/people) on my Master Thesis _Contactless Vital Signs Measurement and Analysis via FMCW radar_. Prior to attending Stevens, I obtained my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Changchun University of Science and Technology (2018).

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a data scientist in Advanced Analytics Group (AAG) at UPS.
