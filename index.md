### Biography 

I believe each experience will build us more comprehensive. We can not connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking backwards. These dots will be somehow connected in our future.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia and advised by Professor [Wenzhan Song](https://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/). Prior to joining UGA, I obtained my M.S. and B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2021) and Changchun University of Science and Technology (2018), respectively. Besides, I had been working as a Data Scientist at UPS for 9 months.

I have an interdisciplinary research background and my research interest lies broadly in vital signs monitoring via contactless sensors, IoT applications, and cyber-physical systems & security.
