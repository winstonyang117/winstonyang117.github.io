<p>I believe each experience will build us more comprehensive. We can not connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking backwards. These dots will be somehow connected in our future.
Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia and advised by Professor Wenzhan Song. Prior to joining UGA, I was working as a full-time Data Scientist at UPS (Advanced Analytical Group). Besides, I obtained my M.S. and B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2021) and Changchun University of Science and Technology (2018), respectively.
I have an interdisciplinary research background and my research interest lies broadly in vital signs monitoring and real-time estimation based on BCG & SCG signals via DNN, IoT applications, and etc. Recently, I'm working on model generalization (domain adaption) and interpretation.. Before I joined MIT, I got my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Notre Dame, supervised by <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~cpoellab/">Dr. Christian Poellabauer</a>. During the 2019 Summer, I was an applied scientist intern working on clinical text mining in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/">AWS Comprehend Medical</a> team, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z8dFyzAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Mohammed Khalilia</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=8F3svqgAAAAJ">Parminder Bhatia</a>. Before coming to Notre Dame, I got my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering (Biomedical Engineering Major) from Fudan University in 2015. My research advisors were <a href="http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/En/Data/View/1767">Dr. Yuanyuan Wang</a> (on ultrasound image denoising) and <a href="http://medianet.azurewebsites.net/">Dr. Yuedong Xu</a> (on network science). My current research interest is computational speech and audio signal analysis, which includes the following topics: speech-based healthcare applications, speech-related computer security and privacy, and speech/audio processing algorithm design. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RCWT_09Ia8DHpOsvsgNG1WVz-CiRmqSP/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[CV]</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MuhvvOkAAAAJ&hl=en;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Scholar</a>]</p>
