<h3>Bio</h3>
<hr />
<p>I believe each experience will build us more comprehensive. We can not connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking backwards. These dots will be somehow connected in our future. Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia and advised by <a href="http://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/">Dr. Wenzhan Song</a>. Prior to joining UGA, I was working as a full-time Data Scientist at UPS (Advanced Analytical Group). Besides, I obtained my M.S. and B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2021) and Changchun University of Science and Technology (2018), respectively. I have an interdisciplinary research background and my research interest lies broadly in vital signs monitoring and real-time estimation based on BCG & SCG signals via DNN, IoT applications, and etc. Recently, I'm working on model generalization (domain adaption) and interpretation.</p>
